 ## Running
 
 The Deployer does not use any strange python modules but can still be run 
 inside a virtual environment fo convenience. The "odd" dependencies are 
 specified in `requirements.txt`. 
 
 ###### To create an environment:
 1. Create a virtual environment inside a dir of choice
    * `virtualenv venv`
 2. Activate environment inside `/deployer` folder
    * `<path_to_venv>/venv/bin/activate`
 3. Install required modules
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
