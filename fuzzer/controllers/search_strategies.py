""" BFS search strategy planner

This script allows generates how the fuzzer is going to traverse the
search space in a BFS/DFS manner.

The input to the script is the max depth K that we are checking.

This file is imported as a module inside the Statespace class
Public functions:

    * bfs - Generates a BFS search strategy
    * dfs - Generates a DFS search strategy
