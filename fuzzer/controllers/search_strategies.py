""" BFS search strategy planner

This script allows generates how the fuzzer is going to traverse the
search space in a BFS manner. It will guide the fuzzer to first check all
network space where there is 1 failed link, then all spaces with 2 and so on.

The input to the script is the depth K that we are checking.

This script requires no weird modules to be installed in the environment.

This file can also be imported as a module or called on its own.
Public functions:

    * get_spreadsheet_cols - returns the column headers of the file
    * main - the main function of the script
